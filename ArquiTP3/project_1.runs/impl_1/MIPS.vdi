WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net uart/rx_uart_instance/data_out_reg[7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin uart/rx_uart_instance/data_out_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell uart/rx_uart_instance/data_out_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
